# Internet-of-Things-Project

Over the last couple of years, Internet of Things (IOT) is one of the major technological tools that
will help to solve the emergence of new and fascinated applications. The Internet of Things creates
opportunities for healthcare to use the Internet of computer devices embedded in a hospital's
everyday practice. IOT creates process, store and receive valuable information and data that may be
beneficial to the healthcare system. IOT can be used for smart architecture for automatic
monitoring and tracking of patients, staff and biomedical units within hospitals and care
institutes(Catarinucci,Donno,Mainetti & et al., 2015).
IOT can create a healthcare based on different technologies specifically in RFID and NFC, which
creates a better network infrastructure. IOT can also collect important data that can be used for
related health care processes. Information is valuable to healthcare as it can provide support for
better decision-making processes and can provide feedback to consumers(Uckelmann, Harrison, &
Michahelles, 2011). The health care can through self-learning and self-improvement, make decisions
that can be proposed through Artificial Intelligence, focusing on computer-aided tools with collected
data acquired by sensors and records of previous patients and diagnoses( Zeng, Chen, & Fan, 2016).
Through historical data there can be created effective treatments and it result a dynamic healthcare
system. RFID allow you to access this information. The data can be used in future in global practice
that can be implemented and standardized into health care systems worldwide. Our primary focus
will be how IOT makes it possible to change and strengthen the healthcare.
The recent acquisition of IOT technology will connect the current resources in the healthcare system
and provide effective solutions for secure medication administration .RFID and NFC chips, medical
checkups can make the right amount of patient observations. The possibility of using IOT can create
an intelligent and smart healthcare that activates technologies and methods in the form of IOT based
smart devices. These important points and factors will be presented and designed in the next
section. In addition, there will be a section where we focusing privacy and security with the IOT
technology
