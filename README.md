Over the last couple of years, Internet of Things (IOT) is one of the major technological tools that
will help to solve the emergence of new and fascinated applications. The Internet of Things creates
opportunities for healthcare to use the Internet of computer devices embedded in a hospital's
everyday practice. IOT creates process, store and receive valuable information and data that may be
beneficial to the healthcare system. IOT can be used for smart architecture for automatic
monitoring and tracking of patients, staff and biomedical units within hospitals and care
institutes(Catarinucci,Donno,Mainetti & et al., 2015).
IOT can create a healthcare based on different technologies specifically in RFID and NFC, which
creates a better network infrastructure. IOT can also collect important data that can be used for
related health care processes. Information is valuable to healthcare as it can provide support for
better decision-making processes and can provide feedback to consumers(Uckelmann, Harrison, &
Michahelles, 2011). The health care can through self-learning and self-improvement, make decisions
that can be proposed through Artificial Intelligence, focusing on computer-aided tools with collected
data acquired by sensors and records of previous patients and diagnoses( Zeng, Chen, & Fan, 2016).
Through historical data there can be created effective treatments and it result a dynamic healthcare
system. RFID allow you to access this information. The data can be used in future in global practice
that can be implemented and standardized into health care systems worldwide. Our primary focus
will be how IOT makes it possible to change and strengthen the healthcare.
The recent acquisition of IOT technology will connect the current resources in the healthcare system
and provide effective solutions for secure medication administration .RFID and NFC chips, medical
checkups can make the right amount of patient observations. The possibility of using IOT can create
an intelligent and smart healthcare that activates technologies and methods in the form of IOT based
smart devices. These important points and factors will be presented and designed in the next
section. In addition, there will be a section where we focusing privacy and security with the IOT
technology

## IOT enabling and the impact in the health care system
IOT is an important factor because it creates interconnections of public facilities and via computer
devices that can embed objects.
Primary radio frequency identification tags (RFID) and sensors are present everywhere thanks to
network-based interactions, which means that you can send and receive real-time data that creates
effective decisions and activities in the healthcare sector. (Yin,Zeng,Chen & Fan, 2016)
IOT technology can provide medical rehabilitation via one stop service for patients and citizens living
in remote locations.
One of the main arguments in the article is that the health service is provided with smart and
convenient treatment of patients, and important rehabilitation services are sent to local hospitals,
but information and information are limited in a hospital. (Yin, Zeng, Chen & Fan, 2016). It should be
pointed out that instead of having a local data server has a large data processing system, where you
can systematically implement an intelligent IOT-based health system that can make processes faster
in local hospitals, making data and information available.
I want to look into technologies such as RFID,cloud computing and communication technologies to
create accessibility in the healthcare sector and make it easier for doctors and hospitals to get
effective data and information.


## The healthcare industry can achieve economical long-term benefits of RFID technology
 ## The focus of this section is to look at the economic benefits and health benefits of implementing RFID technology.
Based on the study of RFID technology in the healthcare sector, we will look at the business
opportunities and the negative consequences of this in terms of security and privacy.
RFID is a new technology that has quickly been implemented in healthcare and hospitals. RFID can
lead to tremendous benefits in benefiting from technology in many areas like healthcare from active
tracking to patient care for access control. RFID can create business benefits by creating IOT based
health applications that can provide improvements in terms of improved healthcare, smart
implementation, technological superiority of RFID applications and public incentives.
(Gupta,Kundu & Codanda,2015)
"The value of the RFID market rose from around 5.63 billion. USD in 2010 to almost 5.84 billion. USD
in 2011. The global turnover in the RFID readers and RFID tags market alone is expected to reach 8.9
billion. Dollars by 2015. In 2011, nearly 150 million RFID brands were used in the supply chain for
healthcare. Sales of RFID tags and systems were expected to reach nearly $ 1.43 billion in 2019, an
increase of 51% from 2009 ".(Manzoor, A,2016)
A case study that has designed 2 lightweight RFID-based healthcare system solutions to ensure
medication administration in hospitals. The study has carried out the system to hospitals so it can
help professionals avoid human error and achieve system security through evidence. This case study
will be focused on in the next section where the Business Canvas model will come in and look at RFID
as a solution.(Yen,Lo & Wo,2012)
